(* Double-continuation backtracking monads are reasonable folklore for
   "search" implementations (including Tac interactive prover's
   tactics). Yet it's quite hard to wrap your head around these.  I
   recommand reading a few times the "Backtracking, Interleaving, and
   Terminating Monad Transformers" paper by O. Kiselyov, C. Chen,
   D. Fridman.  The peculiar shape of the monadic type is reminiscent
   of that of the continuation monad transformer.

   The paper also contains the rational for the [split] abstraction.

   An explanation of how to derive such a monad from mathematical
   principle can be found in "Kan Extensions for Program Optimisation" by
   Ralf Hinze. *)
